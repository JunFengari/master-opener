### Welcome!
Master Opener lets you launch single programs or entire course/workflow suites from your terminal with simple commands.
It’s designed for students or developers who want to automate opening multiple apps, documents, and websites for their work or courses.
This is the first version of this program, and I designed it with bare minimum functionality. If you wish to add more complex error handling
and timing on opening apps, go ahead!

### Instructions
The powershell script contains brief instructions. 
You'll have to configure your environmental variables if you want to use this as simply as possible, configure any Task-Schedulers needed when running from Admin terminal,
add all your personal file and program paths, and rename variables for the script to work properly. This is essentially just the skeleton of the script. 

You can initially run the script with .\open.ps1 -app "help", and later with configuration you should just be able to type "open help" and any other open command from
anywhere in your terminal.
